## 1. Easy Mode (Deposit in Furnance)

Target Customer: Use the Clever to gain more CVX.

Step 1: I have 100 $CVX that I deposit into CLever. This gives me the immediate ability to claim 500 clevCVX. My current position is:

- 1000 CVX deposited
- 0 clevCVX owed
- 500 clevCVX claimable

Step 2: After I claim all 500 clevCVX, my position is:

- 1000 CVX deposited
- 500 clevCVX owed
- 0 clevCVX claimable

Step 3: I decide to deposit my clevCVX 500 into the Furnace, my position is:

- 1000 CVX deposited
- 500 clevCVX owed
- 0 clevCVX claimable
- 500 clevCVX deposited in Furnace
- 500 CVX pending in Furnace

Step 4 (No action for user): After the harvest, assume there's 1 M CVX in CLever, 300K of clevCVX in Furance and the bribe round harvest is 8K CVX after fees. I get 13.3 CVX (500 clevCVX / 300K clevCVX in Furnance => 0.167% \* 8K CVX harvest)

- 1000 CVX deposited
- 500 clevCVX owed
- 0 clevCVX claimable
- 486.7 clevCVX deposited in Furnace
- 486.7 CVX pending in Furnace
- 13.3 CVX claimable in Furnace
